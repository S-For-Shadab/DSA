Peek in function just gives last element present in stack:-
[1,2,3,4]
o/p:4

>>>Push karne ke time dekho ki stack full hai na nahi aur initially topofstack pointer banao aur usko -1 alue do!!
if we want to do pop operation see that stack is empty or not.

>>>>For deleting the stack if we have implemented with array ,
just put arr=null;
and print "Stack is deleted"

.>>>>Linkedlist operation me push karna hai to usko head se connect karege !!!!,ya to head null hoga yaa to kisi se connect hoga to dhyaan me rakhna


.>.>>Delete karna hai stack ko to seedha head ko null  hahahahahahah!!!!
