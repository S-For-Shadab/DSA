##STRING BUILDER :-it is like string onlu but it will not make new element in heap memory when we concatenate and hence saves time


StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder("Tony");
sysout(sb);   ///Tony

sb.charAt(0)  ///T

We can also set characters in stringbuilder

sb.setCharAt(0,'P');
sysout(sb);///Pony



we can also insert character

sb.insert(0,'S');
sysout(sb);   ////SPony


we can also delete substring in string

sb.delete(2,3);
sysout(sb);  ///SPny


we can append element in string builder

sb.append("l");
sysout(sb);  ////SPnyl
