For deleting the element in any location :-
Node temp=head;
for(int i=0;i<location-1;i++){
temp=temp.next;
}
temp.next=temp.next.next;


>>>In Single linked list just made head=tail=null; 
to delete all elements in a limkedlist but in circular singly linkedlist there 
is a catch we have to make tail.next=null too.... GUESS WHY?????????????????
